# Helpful Widgets

Adds multiple helpful widget content types. These are basic widgets that are added by built-in Orchard Core recipes though in case of using a custom setup recipe these can be added by this feature too.

Includes:

- ContainerWidget: Works as a container for further widgets. It has a FlowPart attached to it so it can contain additional widgets as well.
- HtmlWidget: Adds HTML editing and displaying capabilities using a WYSIWYG editor.
- LiquidWidget: Adds Liquid code editing and rendering capabilities.
- MenuWidget: Renders a Bootstrap navigation menu as a widget using the provided `MenuItem`s.
