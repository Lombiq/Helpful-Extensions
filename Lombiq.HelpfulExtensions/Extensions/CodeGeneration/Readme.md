# Code Generation Helpful Extensions

## Content definition code generation

Generates migration code from content definitions. You can use this to create (or edit) a content type on the admin and then move its creation to a migration class. Generated migration code is displayed under the content types' editors, just enable the feature. Check out [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOlsLaIzgm8) to see this in action.
